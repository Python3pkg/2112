Shows 2112' starman on terminal.

### Motivation

I wanted a separator to use on my terminal to make easier the read of output commands. I quickly created a script on my `PATH`, put some "-----" or anything like that on it, and it worked. **BUT**, why not do that and at same time, make a tribute to the *BIGGEST BAND IN THE WORLD*: **RUSH**!!!

### Instalation

`pip install 2112`

### Usage

Try it on your terminal:

`2112`

and see the 2112' starman appears.
